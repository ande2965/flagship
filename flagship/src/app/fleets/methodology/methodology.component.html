    <p>
      In general, all statistics are derived by modeling the probabilities of each die in the
      attack pool, applying enabled attack effects (in order), and then using the final probabilities
      of each die in the pool to calculate statistics like mean, standard deviation, the coefficient of
      variance, and the probability of obtaining at least X results (for example, at least one critical).
      Flagship uses a branching attack pool model to simulate the probability of conditional effects. For example,
      if the probability of using a reroll effect is 60%, the model will split into two probability pools - one
      with the reroll applied (at P = 60%) and one unchanged pool (at P = 40%). This means that applying more
      than one conditional effect creates a tree of probabilities and that the order of effects can be significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flagship applies a default effect ordering that makes sense for most scenarios:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Armament Changes (for example, Spinal Armament)</li>
      <li>Unconditional Dice Additions (for example, External Racks)</li>
      <li>Dice Replacement Effects (for example, Commander Sato)</li>
      <li>Conditional Dice Additions (for example, a Concentrate Fire Dial)</li>
      <li>Unconditional<sup>*</sup> Rerolls (for example, Darth Vader)</li>
      <li>Conditional Rerolls (for example, Leading Shots)</li>
      <li>Die Modifications (for example, H9 Turbolasers)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You are free (with the exception of armament changing effects) to re-order and enable/disable the effects.</p>
    <p class="text-muted footnote"><sup>*</sup>Unconditional from the perspective of affecting the attack pool in a
      negative way. For example,
      the cost of Darth Vader spending a defense token for a reroll is not modeled as part of these calculations.
    </p>
    <h3>Reroll Strategies</h3>
    <p>
      Reroll effects (such as Leading Shots or Darth Vader) allow you to specify a reroll strategy.  Flagship allows you
      to specify whether or not you would reroll accuracies, single hits, and/or black hits.  Blank dice are always assumed
      to be rerolled if possible.

      <h3>Specific Effect Methodologies</h3>

        <mat-expansion-panel *ngIf="hasEffect('Leading Shots')">
          <mat-expansion-panel-header>
            Leading Shots
          </mat-expansion-panel-header>
          <p>
              This effect is more complicated to model. There are two considerations - 
              first, what is the probability that the effect should be applied, and second, which blue
              die should be removed from the pool in which the effect is applied.  Flagship makes a general
              assumption that Leading Shots will be used when at least two dice in the pool are blank.  This
              is calculated using the probability of a Poisson Binomial distribution.
          </p>
          <p>
              When choosing which blue die to remove from the attack pool, Flagship selects the least modified die.  If more than one
              die has been modified an equal number of times, the die with the probability distribution closest
              to the natural distribution of a blue die is selected.  The rationale here is that you are more likely
              to sacrifice a die that has not been steered towards specific results through preceding effects.  This
              is, of course, not a perfect assumption; keep in mind that this simulation of Leading Shots is a general
              use case rather than a comprehensive one.

              Veteran Gunners
            </mat-expansion-panel-header>
            <p>
                Veteran Gunners creates a conditional attack pool where the probability of using the reroll effect
                is the probability that at least half your attack pool results are blanks.  The rerolled pool is a 
                "fresh" pool where each result is equal to an unmodified roll.  There are, of course, other situations
                where you might want to use Veteran Gunners but this metric is probably a good rule of thumb.
